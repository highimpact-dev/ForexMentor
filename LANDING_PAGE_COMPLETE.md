## Development Server

The app is running at:
- **Local**: http://localhost:3004
- **Convex Dashboard**: Available via `convex dashboard`

## Database Schema

### Waitlist Table
```typescript
waitlist: {
  email: string,
  name: string,
  joinedAt: number,
}
// Indexed by email to prevent duplicates
```

## Key Differences from Original Spec

1. **Waitlist instead of Free Account**: Changed all CTAs to "Join the Waitlist" instead of "Open Your FREE Account"
2. **No pricing section**: Removed since we're in pre-launch waitlist mode
3. **Simplified mockups**: Added placeholder text for visual mockups (can be replaced with actual designs later)
4. **Success flow**: Added immediate feedback after signup

## Next Steps (Future Enhancements)

1. Add actual mockup images for the "How It Works" section
2. Add email notification system for waitlist confirmations
3. Add analytics tracking for conversions
4. Add more animations and micro-interactions
5. Create admin dashboard to view waitlist entries
6. Add social proof counter showing number of signups
7. Optimize images and add proper alt texts
8. Add SEO metadata and Open Graph tags

## Commands

```bash
# Start development server
npm run dev

# Build for production
npm run build

# Start production server
npm start

# View Convex dashboard
convex dashboard
```
