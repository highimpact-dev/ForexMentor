# **Website Landing Page Specification: ForexMentor AI**

**Objective:** To drive sign-ups for the ForexMentor AI platform, primarily targeting the free "Bronze Trader" tier to capture leads and convert them into paying customers later. The page must clearly communicate the unique value proposition: combining AI-powered psychology coaching with social accountability to solve the core reasons beginners fail.

**Target Audience:** Beginner forex traders who are struggling with emotional decisions (FOMO, revenge trading), feel isolated in their learning journey, and are at risk of quitting within their first 90 days. They have likely tried other platforms like TradingView or brokers' demos but found them lacking in psychological guidance.

**Key Message (UVP):** "Stop Trading on Emotion. Start Trading with a Plan." ForexMentor AI is the only platform that tackles the 95% of trading failures your broker ignores—your psychology.\

## **Landing Page Structure & Content**

### **1. Hero Section**

- **Objective:** Immediately grab the visitor's attention and communicate the core value proposition in a single, compelling screen.
- **Headline:** **Stop Guessing. Start Trading with an AI Co-Pilot.**
- **Sub-headline:** The first paper trading platform that combines an AI psychology coach with a social accountability system. Defeat the emotions that cost you money and build a winning discipline.
- **Visual:** A clean, animated GIF or short video showcasing the app's dashboard. The animation should cycle through three key features:
  1. The "Pre-Trade Readiness Score" blocking an impulsive trade.
  2. The "Emotional Trade Replay" showing red (anxious) and green (calm) dots on a chart.
  3. A notification of a message from an "Accountability Partner".
- **Primary CTA (Call to Action):** A prominent button with the text: **"Start Your Free Trial"**

### **2. Problem / Agitation Section**

- **Objective:** Resonate with the visitor's pain points and validate their struggles. Make them think, "They understand my problem."
- **Headline:** **Why Do 85% of Traders Quit? (It’s Not Their Strategy.)**
- **Content:** A three-column layout with icons, highlighting the core problems:
  - **Emotional Trading:** Revenge trading after a loss? Jumping into trades out of FOMO? These impulses destroy more accounts than bad strategies.
  - **Total Isolation:** Learning alone is demotivating. With no one to review your trades or keep you disciplined, it's easy to develop bad habits and quit.
  - **Information Overload:** Standard platforms give you endless charts and tools but zero guidance on how to manage your mindset—the most critical factor for success.
- **Visual:** Simple, relatable icons for each column (e.g., a stormy cloud over a brain, a single person at a desk, a tangled web of lines).

### **3. Solution Section**

- **Objective:** Introduce ForexMentor AI as the definitive solution to the problems just presented.
- **Headline:** **Introducing ForexMentor AI: Your All-in-One Psychology & Accountability Coach.**
- **Content:** Introduce the three core pillars as the solution, each with a short benefit statement.
  - **1. AI Psychology Coach:** Get real-time feedback on your emotional state *before* you risk a dime. Our AI identifies and helps you break costly psychological patterns.
  - **2. Social Accountability System:** Never trade alone again. Get matched with a partner to stay disciplined, join group challenges, and learn from a supportive community.
  - **3. Guided Paper Trading:** Practice your strategy with a smart platform that analyzes your psychological performance, not just your P&L.

### **4. "How It Works" Showcase**

- **Objective:** Demonstrate the key "magic" features in a simple, easy-to-understand 3-step process.
- **Step 1: Get Your Pre-Trade Readiness Score.**
  - **Description:** Before every trade, answer three simple questions. Our AI analyzes your recent emotional state, win/loss streak, and habits to give you a 0-100 score. If the risk of emotional trading is too high, we'll block the trade and save you from yourself.
  - **Visual:** A mock-up of the simple pre-trade check modal window with the "Readiness Score" dial.
- **Step 2: Connect with Your Accountability Partner.**
  - **Description:** We'll match you with another beginner in your timezone. Share trades, review each other's progress, and commit to weekly goals. Having a partner is proven to increase discipline by over 50%.
  - **Visual:** A graphic showing two user avatars connecting with a chat bubble between them that says, "Did you stick to your plan this week?"
- **Step 3: Review Your Emotional Patterns.**
  - **Description:** Use our Emotional Trade Replay to see exactly how anxiety, fear, or overconfidence impacts your results. Our AI will generate a weekly report with insights like, "You lose 80% of trades on Fridays when you log 'Frustrated'."
  - **Visual:** The "Emotional Trade Replay" chart with red and green dots, and a pop-up showing an AI insight.

### **5. Social Proof & Testimonials Section**

- **Objective:** Build trust and credibility by showing that others have found success with the platform.
- **Headline:** **From Trading in Isolation to Growing with Confidence.**
- **Content:** Use persona-based testimonials that address key pain points.
  - *"The Pre-Trade check blocked me from revenge trading three times this week. I was angry and ready to blow my virtual account, but it stopped me. Incredibly valuable."* - Alex R.
  - *"My accountability partner has been a game-changer. We hold each other to our trading plans. It's the first time I've been consistent for a whole month."* - Sarah P.
  - *"The AI insights are scary accurate. It pointed out that my win rate drops 70% after two consecutive losses. I never would have seen that pattern on my own."* - Michael B.

### **6. Pricing Section**

- **Objective:** Clearly present the available plans and encourage sign-ups for the free tier.
- **Headline:** **Start for Free. Upgrade When You're Ready.**
- **Content:** A simple pricing table with three columns for the **Bronze (Free)**, **Silver ($29/mo)**, and **Gold ($49/mo)** plans.
  - The **Silver** plan should be highlighted as "Most Popular".
  - Each plan should have a bulleted list of its key features.
  - The CTA button for the free plan should be the most prominent: **"Start for Free"**.

### **7. Final CTA / FAQ Section**
