# ForexMentor AI

**Stop Trading on Emotion. Start Trading with a Plan.**

ForexMentor AI is a psychology-focused forex paper trading platform that combines AI-powered trade analysis with social accountability features. Unlike traditional demo accounts that offer zero feedback, ForexMentor AI addresses the core reason 85% of traders fail: emotions and isolation.

## üéØ Vision

The only beginner trading platform that addresses **WHY** 85% fail (emotions + isolation), not just **HOW** to trade.

**The Winning Formula:**
Paper trading + AI coaching + social accountability + psychological training = A platform that helps beginners build the discipline and emotional control to succeed.

## ‚ú® Key Features

- **Trade Blocking**: Prevents revenge trading and impulsive decisions by blocking trades when your psychological state is compromised

### üë• Social Accountability System (Post-MVP)
- **Accountability Partners**: 1-on-1 matching with traders in your timezone for mutual support and goal-setting

## üöÄ Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 20+
- npm or pnpm
- Convex account
- Clerk account

### Installation

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/forexmentor.git
cd forexmentor

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Set up environment variables
cp .env.example .env.local
```

### Environment Variables

Create a `.env.local` file with:

```env
# Convex
NEXT_PUBLIC_CONVEX_URL=your_convex_url

# Clerk Authentication
NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=your_clerk_publishable_key
CLERK_SECRET_KEY=your_clerk_secret_key
CLERK_JWT_ISSUER_DOMAIN=your_clerk_jwt_issuer
```

### Development

Start both the frontend and backend in parallel:

```bash
npm run dev
```

This runs:
- `next dev` - Next.js development server (localhost:3000)
- `convex dev` - Convex backend with real-time sync

Or run them separately:

```bash
npm run dev:frontend  # Next.js only
npm run dev:backend   # Convex only
```

### Build & Deploy

```bash
# Build for production
npm run build

# Start production server
npm start

# Lint code
npm run lint
```

## üèóÔ∏è Tech Stack

- **Frontend**: Next.js 15 (App Router), React 19, TypeScript
- **Backend**: Convex (serverless backend with real-time database)
- **Authentication**: Clerk
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS v4, shadcn/ui components
- **Themes**: next-themes for dark/light mode
- **AI**: OpenAI GPT-4 (via Vercel AI SDK) - Coming in MVP
- **Market Data**: Polygon.io Forex API - Coming in MVP

## üéì Key Concepts

### Convex Backend

This project uses Convex for the backend. Key patterns:

- **Function Syntax**: Always use new syntax with `args`, `returns`, and `handler`
- **Validators**: Every function must have validators for arguments and return values
- **File-based Routing**: Functions in `convex/example.ts` are accessed via `api.example.functionName`
- **Public vs Internal**: Use `query`/`mutation`/`action` for public API, `internalQuery`/`internalMutation`/`internalAction` for private functions

See `.cursor/rules/convex_rules.mdc` for complete guidelines.

### Authentication Flow

- Unauthenticated users accessing `/dashboard` or `/server` ‚Üí redirected to `/sign-in`
- Authenticated users accessing `/sign-in` or `/sign-up` ‚Üí redirected to `/dashboard`
- Root page `/` is publicly accessible

### Provider Chain

The app wraps components in this order:
```
ClerkProvider ‚Üí ConvexClientProvider ‚Üí ThemeProvider ‚Üí children
```
